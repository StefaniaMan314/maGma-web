    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      Racoş is a village with a little over 2,500 inhabitants belonging to several ethnic minorities. 
      In the heart of this village, located 60 km from Brasov, there is a geological complex that, not long ago, became a protected area. 
      Here are the Extinct Volcano, the Emerald Lake and the Basalt Quarry. Also here was the quarry of exploitation of the basaltic rocks 
      Brazi which left behind a basin with a diameter of 400 meters and a depth of 10 meters in which the Emerald Lake was formed. 
      An artificial lake with a special color and many living and recent stories about its formation and transformation from the 2000's until now.
    </p>
    <p>
      This place challenged our imagination. From the thousand-year-old volcano that transformed the colors and stones of the surrounding land, being 
      the last active volcano in the Carpathian Mountains, to the newly formed emerald-colored lake. From the industrial career of basalt rock mining 
      to the accident that created, with the help of the villagers, a wonder of post-industrial nature with a magical color and sound. From the huge 
      walls with basalt rocks that invite you to enter and immerse yourself in the shapes and colors of the historical layers of a piece of land, 
      to the multitude of ethnicities and cultures that coexist in a small and poor village in the heart of Transylvania. Fire. Earth. The water. Stone. Culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to us a magical place where the education of the senses and the much needed transformation of the relationship we have with nature can 
      happen with care and respect for the elements of nature and communities.

              <p>
                Vânia Rovisco is a performer and dancer, creator of installations and durational pieces through which explores and updates relational processes. With a work strongly anchored in research and consequent creation of a procedural embodiment, made for, working with the public manufacturing experiences mediated spatial modeling, temporal and perceptual. To this end uses the simple articulation of meaning devices such as wording, the formal hybridity, the cadence and articulation of time, the use of inherited geometries of choreography’s use for affirmation or disruption of social standardization, such entries and projections are displayed on the body and modes. Bringing the performative work towards the geography of affections and relations (framing, accelerating, intensifying the bodies), including it in the gallery space – requiring therefore a recasting of the guidelines, expectations and involvement, turning the public into a co-creator attaining singular experience, mediator of the results, and living document of the process.

              <p>
                After graduating from the National University of Arts in Bucharest as a set designer, his main field of activity so far has been theater. His video works also developed outside the theater, mainly as part of the installations he created together with artists from different fields. His work is developed in several interconnected media, such as stage design, video art, animation and sound. He explored topics such as perception, the impact of the virtual on the analog or the creative possibilities of the event. He has always been interested in location politics as a meeting place, so in a way, his work in this category can be considered site specific. The main theme of his art can be traced from the perspective of the relationship between man and the environment. He recently completed a master's degree in theater directing and intends to explore the crossroads of theater and the performing arts, installations, video and sound.

She collaborates with designers, musicians, dancers and performers plus she takes part in artivist initiatives such as Linha Vermelha and Zero Waste Lab – for a more conscious future and less plastic!
